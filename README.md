Project Overview
Theme: Healthcare

Project Title: Comprehensive Prenatal Health Support Platform

Mission Statement:
Our project aims to create an accessible, all-in-one digital platform tailored for pregnant women, particularly in urban areas. We strive to provide a seamless experience that combines essential prenatal care resources, support tools, and education, addressing unique health and wellness needs throughout the nine months of pregnancy.

Problem Statement
In urban India, many expecting mothers face barriers to reliable, comprehensive prenatal support, leading to gaps in care that may impact maternal health outcomes.

Nutritional Guidance: Stage-specific recommendations for a healthy pregnancy.
Appointment Reminders: Reduce risks associated with missed prenatal visits.
Gynecologist Locator: Helps users quickly find nearby healthcare providers.
Educational Content: Resources to address pregnancy myths and lifestyle factors.
This resource-rich platform is designed for urban mothers-to-be, providing an intuitive, mobile-friendly experience that helps them stay informed and proactive about their health.
